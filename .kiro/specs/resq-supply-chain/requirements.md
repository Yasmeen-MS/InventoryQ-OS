# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ResQ OS is a Zero-Touch logistics system designed for the "AI for Good" hackathon. The system serves Hospitals, Public Distribution Systems (PDS), and NGOs by predicting stockouts and automatically ordering supplies using real-time data integration with Snowflake as the core platform.

## Glossary

- **ResQ_System**: The complete self-healing supply chain application
- **Multi_Tenant_Core**: Single database schema handling multiple organization types
- **Simulation_Engine**: Deterministic high-fidelity simulation system providing realistic external data
- **Python_Simulation_UDFs**: Snowflake Python UDFs that generate realistic simulation data
- **Self_Healing_Engine**: Automated stockout prediction and procurement system
- **Validation_View**: Simple Streamlit interface for testing functionality
- **Chaos_Button**: Testing mechanism to simulate critical stock scenarios
- **Purchase_Order**: Automated procurement request generated by the system
- **Critical_Stock**: Stock level requiring immediate action (typically ≤ 3 days remaining)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenant Core Database

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a unified database schema that handles three different sectors (Hospital, PDS, NGO), so that all organizations can use the same platform with sector-specific configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Multi_Tenant_Core SHALL store data for Hospital (Oxygen), PDS (Rice), and NGO (Kits) sectors in a single schema
2. WHEN dummy data is inserted for all three sectors, THE ResQ_System SHALL display all sectors in the same unified table
3. THE Multi_Tenant_Core SHALL maintain data isolation between different organizations while sharing the schema structure
4. WHEN querying sector-specific data, THE ResQ_System SHALL filter results based on organization type and permissions

### Requirement 2: High-Fidelity Simulation Engine

**User Story:** As a logistics coordinator, I want the system to use deterministic, high-fidelity simulation data (weather, traffic, vendor availability), so that delivery predictions and procurement decisions are based on realistic conditions that guarantee consistent demo behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather data is requested for 'Bangalore', THE Simulation_Engine SHALL return 'Rain' with risk multiplier 1.5x
2. WHEN weather data is requested for 'Delhi', THE Simulation_Engine SHALL return 'Haze' with appropriate risk factors
3. WHEN vendor availability is checked, THE Simulation_Engine SHALL return realistic latency data (Blinkit = 12ms, Dunzo = Offline)
4. THE Simulation_Engine SHALL provide 99.99% realistic data that mimics real-world API responses
5. THE ResQ_System SHALL never fail during demonstrations due to simulation data being deterministic and reliable

### Requirement 3: Self-Healing Automation Engine

**User Story:** As a supply chain manager, I want the system to automatically detect critical stock levels and generate purchase orders, so that stockouts are prevented without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Self_Healing_Engine SHALL automatically calculate DAYS_REMAINING for all inventory items
2. WHEN stock reaches Critical_Stock levels, THE Self_Healing_Engine SHALL automatically generate a Purchase_Order
3. WHEN the Chaos_Button is activated, THE ResQ_System SHALL immediately drop stock to 0 and generate a visible Purchase_Order in the log table
4. THE Self_Healing_Engine SHALL log all automated actions with timestamps and reasoning
5. WHEN multiple items reach critical levels simultaneously, THE ResQ_System SHALL prioritize orders based on criticality and sector importance

### Requirement 4: Test-Driven Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple validation interfaces for every feature, so that I can verify functionality works before building complex UIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. FOR EACH major feature, THE ResQ_System SHALL provide a corresponding Validation_View
2. WHEN testing API connectivity, THE Validation_View SHALL display raw JSON responses from external APIs
3. WHEN testing automation logic, THE Validation_View SHALL show step-by-step processing results
4. THE Validation_View SHALL be implemented using simple Streamlit interfaces
5. WHEN validation tests pass, THEN THE ResQ_System SHALL be ready for production UI development

### Requirement 5: Deterministic Simulation Reliability

**User Story:** As a hackathon presenter, I want the system to use deterministic simulation that guarantees consistent behavior during demonstrations, so that the demo showcases our core self-healing capabilities without any variability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same city is queried multiple times, THE Simulation_Engine SHALL return identical weather data every time
2. THE Simulation_Engine SHALL generate realistic weather and traffic data that follows real-world patterns
3. WHEN displaying simulated data, THE ResQ_System SHALL clearly indicate it is using high-fidelity simulation
4. THE ResQ_System SHALL maintain full functionality using only simulation data
5. WHEN switching between different simulation scenarios, THE ResQ_System SHALL preserve all core logic and calculations

### Requirement 6: Snowflake-Native Simulation Architecture

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want the system to leverage Snowflake's native Python UDF capabilities for simulation, so that the solution is optimized for the Snowflake ecosystem without requiring external network access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ResQ_System SHALL use Snowflake Dynamic Tables for real-time data processing
2. THE ResQ_System SHALL integrate Snowflake Cortex AI for predictive analytics
3. THE ResQ_System SHALL implement Python Simulation UDFs for all external data needs
4. WHEN processing large datasets, THE ResQ_System SHALL leverage Snowflake's compute scaling
5. THE ResQ_System SHALL store all application logic within Snowflake using stored procedures and UDFs

### Requirement 7: Sector-Specific Logic

**User Story:** As a sector specialist, I want the system to handle different supply types and requirements for each sector, so that Hospital oxygen needs, PDS rice distribution, and NGO kit management are properly addressed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing Hospital supplies, THE ResQ_System SHALL track oxygen levels with medical-grade criticality thresholds
2. WHEN managing PDS supplies, THE ResQ_System SHALL handle rice distribution with government compliance requirements
3. WHEN managing NGO supplies, THE ResQ_System SHALL track emergency kits with disaster response priorities
4. THE ResQ_System SHALL apply sector-specific business rules for reorder points and quantities
5. WHEN calculating delivery times, THE ResQ_System SHALL consider sector-specific urgency levels

### Requirement 8: Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want real-time visibility into stock levels and automated actions, so that I can monitor the system's self-healing capabilities and intervene when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ResQ_System SHALL provide real-time dashboards showing current stock levels across all sectors
2. WHEN automated actions are taken, THE ResQ_System SHALL send immediate notifications to relevant stakeholders
3. THE ResQ_System SHALL maintain an audit log of all automated decisions and actions
4. WHEN critical situations arise, THE ResQ_System SHALL escalate alerts to appropriate personnel
5. THE ResQ_System SHALL display system health status including API connectivity and data freshness
